# Fall 2024 STAT 605 Project Group 1: Spotify Charts Analysis

Repository for scripts to run our analysis automatically on CHTC.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project and get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/projectGroup1.git
cd projectGroup1
```

### 2. Download the Data
Then download the data into your copy of the repository at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunnykakar/spotify-charts-all-audio-data


### 3. Check File Paths
Then check if the file paths are correct for your machine.
WARNING: You will most likely need to change the path to the
*.sif file with a version of R that has all needed R packages.

### 4. Run MASTER.sh
Finally, run MASTER.sh to automatically get all our graphs.
```bash
./MASTER.sh
```

You might need to check the error files for proper file paths, packages,
and permissions.
