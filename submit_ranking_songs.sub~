## IN EDITING PROCESSES

## before running, directories log, error, and output must exist
## this is a TEMPLATE file!! 
## Each Rscript should use a copy of this, replacing script.R with the appropriate Rscript files name
## replace log, error variables with the appropriate subdirectory names
## output should be saved to output/<SCRIPTNAME> subdirectory too, as coded in the Rscript

log = log/project_ranking_songs/$(Cluster).log
error = error/ranking_songs/$(Cluster).err

## output locations controlled by Rscript code
